<h2>A Secular Critique of Nihilism</h2>

<p>This essay poses several arguments attacking the concept of nihilism from a purely secular perspective.  The goal is to persuade secular readers to reconsider the way that existential issues are approached while offering readers who may be curious about nihilism or secular thinking a deeper understanding of the rationale.  I openly admit my bias in that I aim to dissuade readers away from nihilism; I find it to be a serious conceptual ailment.  The goal of this essay is NOT to belittle nihilists for their beliefs (I know all too well how appealing this conceptual framework actually is, as well as how bleak it can be), but rather to address the core tenets of these beliefs in a manner that assumes nothing and builds rationally from the ground up.</p>

<h2>A Secular Analysis of The Gospel</h2>

<p>This is a planned work that will likely take a long time to complete, but involves analyzing several of stories that are fundamental to the Christian doctrine.  The goal is to provide a useful secular perspective on traditional religious texts so that critics may find something of value and advocates might temper their zeal regarding literal interpretations.</p>

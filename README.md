<p>A collection of my written works in their various states of
completion.</p>
<h2 class="western">A Secular Critique of Nihilism</h2>
<p>This essay poses several arguments attacking the concept of
nihilism from a purely secular perspective. The goal is to persuade
secular readers to reconsider the way that existential issues are
approached while offering readers who may be curious about nihilism
or secular thinking a deeper understanding of the rationale. I openly
admit my bias in that I aim to dissuade readers away from nihilism; I
find it to be a serious conceptual ailment. The goal of this essay is
NOT to belittle nihilists for their beliefs (I know all too well how
appealing this conceptual framework actually is, as well as how bleak
it can be), but rather to address the core tenets of these beliefs in
a manner that assumes nothing and builds rationally from the ground
up.</p>
<h2 class="western">A Secular Analysis of Christian Theology</h2>
<p>This is a planned work that will likely take a long time to
complete, but involves analyzing several of stories that are
fundamental to the Christian doctrine. The goal is to provide a
useful secular perspective on traditional religious texts so that
critics may find something of value and advocates might temper their
zeal regarding literal interpretations.</p>
